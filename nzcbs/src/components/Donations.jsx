      <p>
        The Bible School has many costs, any amount (even small) is greatly
        received.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bible School has created a separate "Donations Account" into which
        we welcome donations which will be used for:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Subsidising Bible School fees each year: especially the substantial
          cost to families to make it affordable to attend Bible School.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each year the amount of the subsidy would be based on the amount in
          the fund.
        </li>
        <li>
          To cover additional Bible School costs not included in the fees.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We are a registered charity and can supply a tax receipt for donations,
