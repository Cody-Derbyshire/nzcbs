            <h2>About the school:</h2>
            <p>
              The Lake Taupo school is located 30 minutes south of Taupo. There
              are many attractions to offer Brothers, Sisters and young people,
              as well as being an excellent place where we can share a week
              around God's word surrounded by his marvellous creation in a bush
              setting.

            <h2>Purpose:</h2>
            <p>
              The aim of the Bible School is to give attention to the study of
              God's word and to engage in an encouraging atmosphere centred on
              God's word. As such everything else is secondary to this purpose.

            <h2>John Launchbury</h2>
            <h3>To Theophilus</h3>
            <p>
              This series is centered around the writings of Luke. It explores
              the exciting idea that Luke and Acts were written and submitted as
              legally-binding evidence for Paul’s trial before Caesar. This
              perspective shines new light on Luke’s message, and emphasizes the
              care he took to ensure his whole account was independently
              verifiable. It also helps explain some of the differences between
              the four gospels, and also the different emphases we find between
              Acts and Paul’s letters.

            <h3>What Tomorrow Will Bring</h3>
            <p>
              The preacher saw that the race is not always to the swift, nor the
              battle to the strong. Things do not always go as we expect. God
              has recorded examples of those who were His servants, and
              seemingly set for the Kingdom, but who almost out of the blue
              stumbled and fell away. There are others who were the enemies of
              God, and surely we would have thought beyond hope, but who
              seemingly from nowhere found redemption.

              These people and their life stories are examples for us:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  warnings of dangers that can cause even the strongest to fall,
                </li>
                <li>
                  encouragement that the mercy and grace of God can save anyone
                  from even the darkest of places,
                </li>
                <li>
                  exhortation to put our trust in God, because we don’t know
                  what even tomorrow will bring.
